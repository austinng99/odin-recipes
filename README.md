The current project entails creating a recipe page/website for my favorite dish using HTML.

By the end of it, I should be able to and familiar with creating html files, the boilerplate HTML, headings, a body, unordered lists, and ordered lists.

And using Git, I should be more familiar with staging and committing files.
